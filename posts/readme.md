## Planet Caravan Simple Blog Template


### Best Practices
* Use lots of comments and documentation
* Keep your tabs lined up correctly
* Follow HTML5 element heirarchy
* Double check your title tags and favicon
* Store your local project in a regular folder with no cloud syncing - this can cause issues with running/building the project

### Initialize
* Use Node v16.13.0 - use NVM or another node version manager to set this.
* run `npm install`
* run `npm run dev` - start and serve commands are the same as this by default, customize them if you need to.

### Update Test/Staging Server
This site uses Netlify's auto-deploy functions.  Every time you push to your main branch, Netlify will auto-deploy for you.  


#### Page Links
* [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) - Index/Home
* [http://localhost:3000/posts](http://localhost:3000/posts) - Blog posts directory
	- You can also rename this as "news" by changing the associated folder, file, and variable names.
* [http://localhost:3000/posts/master-post](http://localhost:3000/posts/master-post) - Post master template
	- Update to suit the needs of your project, and keep a clean version to copy from.
* [http://localhost:3000/events](http://localhost:3000/events) - Clone of the Blog section
	- The blog funstions can be cloned, renamed, and reused for things like events, products, people, etc.
