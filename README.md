## Planet Caravan Simple Blog Template ##


### Best Practices ###
* Use lots of comments and documentation
* Keep your tabs lined up correctly
* Follow HTML5 element heirarchy
* Double check your title tags and favicon
* Store your local project in a regular folder with no cloud syncing - this can cause issues with running/building the project

### Initialize ###
* Use Node v14.15.3 - you can just run "npm run nvm" to set
* npm run init-setup (runs multiple setup commands)
* npm run dev (start and serve commands are the same as this by default, customize them if you need to)
